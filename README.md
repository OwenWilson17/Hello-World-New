# Hello-World

## What Is Hello World?

A "Hello, World!" program is a computer program that outputs or displays "Hello, World!" to the user. Being a very simple program in most programming languages, it is often used to illustrate the basic syntax of a programming language for a working program. It is often the very first program people write when they are new to the language. A "Hello, World!" program is traditionally used to introduce novice programmers to a programming language. "Hello world!" is also traditionally used in a sanity test to make sure that a computer language is correctly installed, and that the operator understands how to use it.
